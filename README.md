# Sajal Bhattarai
Data Engineer | Cloud-Native Data Systems | Scalable Architecture

I design and build production-grade data platforms that transform raw data into reliable, analytics-ready systems.

##  Engineering Philosophy

Data engineering is not just about moving data.  
It is about building systems that are predictable, observable, and scalable under real-world constraints.

I focus on:

- Reliability before complexity  
- Performance before abstraction  
- Clarity before cleverness  

---

## 🏗 Core Focus Areas

- Distributed data processing with Apache Spark  
- Production orchestration with Apache Airflow  
- Dimensional modeling (Star & Snowflake schemas)  
- Warehouse optimization & query performance tuning  
- Incremental data loading strategies  
- Medallion (Bronze-Silver-Gold) architecture  
- AI-integrated enrichment pipelines  
- Vector-based semantic search systems  

---

## 🔬 What I Enjoy Building

- End-to-end ELT pipelines from ingestion → transformation → warehouse  
- Systems that process hundreds of thousands to millions of records daily  
- High-availability DAG workflows with SLA monitoring  
- Spark workloads tuned for cost and performance efficiency  
- Structured data models that reduce downstream analytics friction

##  Technical Environment

Python | SQL | Apache Spark | Databricks | Airflow  
Snowflake | PostgreSQL | Redshift | BigQuery  
AWS | Azure | GCP  
Kafka | Docker | Linux | Git
